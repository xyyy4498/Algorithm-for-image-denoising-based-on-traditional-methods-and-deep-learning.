#Image denoising is a crucial step in image processing, playing a significant role in enhancing image quality, improving visual effects, and facilitating subsequent image processing tasks. Traditional image denoising methods mainly include spatial domain-based and frequency domain-based techniques. Spatial domain methods such as mean filtering, median filtering, and non-local means (NLM) eliminate noise by directly manipulating image pixels, whereas frequency domain techniques like Fourier transform and wavelet transform remove high-frequency noise components by converting the image to the frequency domain. While these methods generally have low computational complexity and are easy to implement, they have limitations in handling complex noise environments and preserving image details. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, deep learning-based image denoising methods have become a research hotspot. Deep learning methods construct deep neural networks to learn the noise distribution and denoising patterns of images from large training datasets, achieving efficient image denoising. Among them, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are widely used in image denoising. Classic deep learning denoising models include DnCNN, FFDNet, which utilize multi-layer convolution operations and nonlinear activation functions to capture complex features and noise patterns in images, effectively removing various types of noise.

Deep learning-based image denoising methods have significant advantages over traditional approaches. Firstly, deep learning methods can adaptively learn and extract high-level features of images without the need for manual parameter setting or feature extractors design. Secondly, these methods perform well in handling complex noise and preserving image details, retaining more texture and structural information while removing noise. However, deep learning methods also face challenges such as high computational resource and training data requirements, as well as time-consuming training processes. In practical applications, it is possible to choose suitable denoising methods based on specific needs or design hybrid denoising algorithms combining the strengths of both approaches to achieve superior image denoising results. With the continuous advancement of deep learning technology, deep learning-based image denoising methods are expected to make greater breakthroughs and applications in the future.
